<h3>APP & Web applications related to smart mobility</h3>
    <p>Our team has developed a variety of software toolboxes and apps to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of various smart mobility systems. These include ride-hailing services, electric vehicle systems, and e-hailing taxi markets.

<h3>A Large-Scale Taxi Simulation Platform</h3>
    <p>We propose a novel multi-functional and open-sourced simulation platform for ride-sourcing systems. This platform can simulate the behaviors and movements of various agents on a real transportation network. It provides accessible portals for users to train and test various optimization algorithms, particularly reinforcement learning algorithms, for tasks such as on-demand matching, idle vehicle repositioning, and dynamic pricing.</p>

<h3>An Idle Cruising APP for Taxis</h3>
<p>Our app addresses the issue of 40-60% of taxi time being spent on idle cruising while searching for passengers. It recommends optimal idle searching/cruising routes to taxi drivers in Hong Kong to help mitigate supply and demand imbalances. The cruising recommendation algorithm is powered by a tailored reinforcement learning algorithm.</p>

<h3>Charge Express APP</h3>
<p>By 2025, the Hong Kong Government plans to expand the number of charging stations to 5,000, nearly doubling the current amount. This app helps taxi drivers and other road users find locations and details of both charging stations and taxi stands. It provides navigation and guides users on the best routes to these sites, helping them avoid wasting time.</p>

<h3>A Policy Analysis Toolbox for Taxis</h3>
<p>This web app performs a sensitivity analysis of how taxi market statistics are influenced by fluctuations in fleet size and pricing. It demonstrates varying outcomes on platform revenues, drivers' monthly income, order matching rates, and driver utilization rates following changes in fleet size and pricing. This tool aids government or operators in managing fleet control and adjusting pricing strategies.</p>

<h3>A Simulator for Model Evaluations for Ride-Sourcing Markets</h3>
    <p>Ride-sourcing services have become crucial in meeting people's mobility needs. This project calibrates, validates, and compares various matching functions used in literature for ride-sourcing markets. It includes a simulator that tests 420 scenarios under different supply and demand combinations. The simulator evaluates key performance metrics such as matching rates, average matching time, and total waiting time. An open-sourced package for simulation and model evaluations is available.</p>
